# GURPS 4<sup>th</sup> Edition Star System Generator

The code can be found on GitHub: http://github.com/tschoppi/starsystem-gen/

## What is this?

If you have never heard of the role-playing framework GURPS, check out the following link: http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/

This program was designed to assist the GM by quickly creating a random star system for his gaming group to explore, using the rulebook **GURPS _Space_**. It is primarily aimed at a GM with a group that is more of the adventurous type that travels a lot, but can also be used to generate a good base for a star system that will get details added manually later on.

**GURPS _Space_** is available here: http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/space/

## How do I use this?

Basically, download the code and put it in a folder. Currently installing as a Python module onto the system is not supported, but will come in the future. Some day.

After that have a look at the `example.py` file and modify it to suit your needs. Currently not many options are available, but there will be more!

## I found a bug!
