GURPS4e Star System Generator
=============================

Welcome!
Here lives the automated star system generator for the GURPS Roleplaying frame-
work. I'm not far yet, but many features are to come.

Up until here (the initial commit) we have:
 - GURPS Dice Roller
 - GURPS Stars, with
 	* Mass
	* Spectral Type
 - GURPS Star Systems, with
 	* Age
	* Location (e.g. are we in an open cluster or not)

Planned is the following:
 - Completion of the Star System Generation as described in the rulebook
 - Making output to a .tex document available, for quick and easy generation of
   a Star System Dossier, containing tables with all information that might be
   relevant to the GM.

You may fork this project and make it better!
